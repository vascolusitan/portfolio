            I pursued the bachelorâ€™s degree to have a foundation of my true
            journey into the{" "}
            <span className="primary-color">world of technology</span>.
            <br />

            <span className="primary-color">web development</span>.
            <br />
            It was when I joined <span className="primary-color">

            <span className="primary-color">practical experience</span>, which I
            was lacking.
            <br />
            At the time I started doing the master's degree and working in{" "}
            <span className="primary-color">CGI</span>, I found an interest in{" "}
            <span className="primary-color">good practices</span> and{" "}
            <span className="primary-color">design patterns</span>, improving my
            skills even more.
            <br />
            Currently, I am working at{" "}
            <span className="primary-color">Kuehne + Nagel</span>, this role

            <span className="primary-color">DevOps</span> and represents the
            latest step in my ongoing journey in the tech industry.
